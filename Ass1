        <p>THIS SENTENCE HAS FIVE WORDS. HERE ARE FIVE MORE WORDS.
        FIVE-WORD SENTENCES ARE FINE. BUT SEVERAL TOGETHER BECOME MONOTONOUS. 
        LISTEN TO WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE WRITING IS GETTING BORING.
        THE SOUND OF IT DRONES. IT’S LIKE A STUCK RECORD. THE EAR DEMANDS SOME VARIETY.
        NOW LISTEN. I VARY THE SENTENCE LENGTH, AND I CREATE MUSIC. MUSIC. THE WRITING SINGS.
        IT HAS A PLEASANT RHYTHM, A LILT, A HARMONY. I USE SHORT SENTENCES. 
        AND I USE SENTENCES OF MEDIUM LENGTH. AND SOMETIMES, WHEN I AM CERTAIN THE READER IS RESTED,
        I WILL ENGAGE HIM WITH A SENTENCE OF CONSIDERABLE LENGTH, A SENTENCE THAT BURNS WITH ENERGY AND BUILDS WITH ALL 
        THE IMPETUS OF A CRESCENDO, THE ROLL OF THE DRUMS, THE CRASH OF THE CYMBALS–SOUNDS THAT SAY LISTEN TO THIS, IT IS IMPORTANT</p>
